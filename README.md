# Illinois FGC Website

This repo was cloned from the original template which can be seen [here](https://github.com/OhioFGC/OhioFGC.github.io).

Credit given to the original authors for providing a base to work off of, without which this project would not have gotten off the ground quite as fast.

Illinois is a big state, and contrary to popular belief it is not just Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. The goal here is to provide a starting point for any players new to the area or scene to try and find out more about the FG scenes we have.
