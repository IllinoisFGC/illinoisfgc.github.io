# Illinois Fighting Game Community Website

This repo was cloned from the original template which can be seen [here](https://github.com/OhioFGC/OhioFGC.github.io).

Credit given to the original authors for providing a base to work off of, without which this project would not have gotten off the ground quite as fast.

Illinois is a big state, and contrary to popular belief it is not just Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. The goal here is to provide a starting point for any players new to the area or scene to try and find out more about the fighting game communities we have.

The website is mostly HTML and JavaScript, with Bootstrap 4.3.0 for styling. Currently the site is hosted on GitHub Pages, as the content on the site does not require a host that can provide greater bandwidth nor does the site currently use languages or tools that GitHub Pages does not support.
